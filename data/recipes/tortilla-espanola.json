Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottom or nonstick skillet.&nbsp; Add the potato pieces and onions, then lower the heat and cook the potatoes, stirring frequently so they do not clump together, for 20 minutes, or until they are tender but not browned. The secret of success is to cook the potatoes for a long time so that they absorb the flavor of the oil and are cooked but not browned or crisp and do not fall apart. They are in fact almost boiled rather than pan-fried."

When hot, add the potato and egg mixture, lower the heat and cook for 3-5 minutes, or until the underside is just set. Use a spatula to push the potatoes down into the egg so that they are completely submerged and keep loosening the tortilla from the bottom of the skillet to stop it sticking."

Drain off the oil in the skillet, then quickly turn the skillet upside down so that the tortilla falls onto the plate. Return the skillet to the heat and add a little more of the reserved oil if necessary. Slide the tortilla, cooked side uppermost, back into the skillet and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes, or until set underneath. The tortilla is cooked when it is firm and crisp on the outside but slightly runny in the center."
