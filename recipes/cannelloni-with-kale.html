Start the tomato sauce and keep an eye on it while continuing with the recipe. You'll eventually turn off the heat so the sauce cools a little when you're ready to use it later.

Boil a large pot of water for the kale. 

Clean the kale - cut the leaves off the thick stems. Boil the kale for 5 minutes. Remove it from the pot and let it cool or bathe it in cool water to cool it quickly. Squeeze the kale into a ball to drain as much water as you can. Chop the kale finely. 

Put the ricotta in a mixing bowl and add the chopped kale, the beaten egg, the parmeggiano and salt and pepper to taste. Mix it all together and store it in the fridge until the pasta is ready.

Preheat the oven to 375F. Fetch a baking dish or two. Depending on how you size and arrange your cannelloni, you'll need a 9&quot; x 13&quot; baking dish and at least an 8&quot; x 8&quot; to accommodate them all. Your mileage will vary here depending on the size of your eggs and resulting quantity of pasta dough.

Roll out the pasta dough into sheets the full width of your roller. If you're using a traditional manual pasta machine, roll the dough out to the 2nd-to-thinnest setting you have (on mine that's an 8). 

Put a layer of tomato sauce on a baking dish. It doesn't need to be generous - just enough to keep the cannelloni from sticking to the dish.

To make the cannelloni, using two spoons place the ricotta/greens stuff in a line along the short edge of your pasta sheet leaving about an 1/8&quot;-1/4&quot; gap between the ricotta and the pasta edge. For standard sized cannelloni that mound of ricotta will be about 1&quot;-1.5&quot; wide. Once you've arranged the ricotta so it's uniform roll the edge of the pasta over the ricotta, use a knife or kitchen scraper to cut the pasta just past the seam you made when folding over the pasta. It's okay if there's a bit of overlap with the pasta edges but try to keep it to a minimum. 

Place the cannelloni in the baking dish with the seam down. Arrange them so they are not quite touching.

Once you finish making the cannelloni pour tomato sauce over the cannelloni. Do not drown them - you should still be able to see the cannelloni through a moderate covering of sauce.

Bake for about 20 minutes.
